1. 'Mathematically, time is no different from one more spatial
dimension, but since humans interact with it in a quite different way, it is
psychologically very different.' William P. Thurston, 'On Proof and Progress in Mathematics', p. 5

 This raises a question: what is different between our conception of time and our conception of space?
 Initially I thought that if we visualise a process through time, we can't imagine it 'all at once' which would be possible if we conceived of 
 the process as evolving through space. However, the idea of 'all at once' seems to implicity assume understanding of time, at least if we 
 rephrase it as 'all at the same time'. But possibly we could reduce it to the concept of unity, without referencing time.
 
 2. 'When one considers how hard it is to write a computer program even approaching
the intellectual scope of a good mathematical paper, and how much greater time and
effort have to be put into it to make it ''almost'' formally correct, it is preposterous
to claim that mathematics as we practice it is anywhere near formally correct.' William P. Thurston, 'On Proof and Progress in Mathematics', p. 9-10
